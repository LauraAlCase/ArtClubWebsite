<h2> About Art Club</h2>
<p>
Here in art club we aim to cultivate interest in art throught our LHS community.
Although we part-take in more intriquet art form such as classical-Renissance peinture we welcome people of all skillsets.
Be prepared for fun activities such as pumpkin carving and snowflake cutting. We also part-take in the <em>culinary arts</em>
such as  baking and cupcake decorating. Seasonal foods are promised!
Art Club is where it's at!  It's a place of dreams,fun, and community service hours.
Improving the Community through art.
